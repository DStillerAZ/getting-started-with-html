<h1><b>Lesson 1 notes</b></h1>

<b>Web Basics</b>

<p>The world wide web functions by users sending Hypertext Transfer Protocol (or HTTP) 
requests via web browser to a server. The server then interprets the request and sends the correct HTML
document back to the web browser which interprets and displays it for the user. </p>

<b>HTML</b>

<p>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the language used by the documents that form the majority of
the content on the web. HTML contains <b>text content</b> which is <em>what</em> you see, <b>markup</b>
which is <em>how</em> it looks, <b>references to other doccuments</b> such as <em>images</em>, or <em>videos</em>,
and <b>links</b> to other <em> html pages.</em></p>
  
<b>Tags, Elements and Attributes</b>
  
<p>An HTML element has 3 basic components, an opening tag, it's contents and a closing tag.Tags are used to tell a 
web browswer how to display thier content. Tags look something like this &lt opening tag &gt content &lt /closing
tag &gt. An example is the b tag.  &lt b &gt content &lt b &gt will make the content
appear in <b>bold</b>. An opening tag, content and a closing tag are refered to as an element. Some elements
contain attributes which are found within the opening tag. The anchor tag or &lt a &gt is used
display when the link is clicked.
</p> 
  
<b> Limitations of Computers</b>
  
<p>Computers lack the ability to infer or assume and all instructions given to a computer must be very precise
and literal. This makes syntax critical to HTML.</p>
  
<b> Adding Images</b>
  
<p>Adding images requires the use of the image tag and the source  and alternate attributes <em>"src=" and "alt="</em>.
The source attribute is used to link to the images URL and the alterante attribute displays text when the image 
does not display properly. The alterante text is also used by the blind. The image tag has no content or closing tag 
making it a void tag.</p>
  
<b>Creating White Space</b>
  
<p>All HTML content is defualt interpreted as a single line (see limitations of computers). If you desire any white 
space you must create it with HTML tags. There are two types of linebreak tags &lt br &gt (break) 
which creates a single line break per tag (this is a void tag as it does not require a closing tag) and 
&lt p &gt (paragraph) which creates an invisible box around it's content.</p>
  
<b>Inline and Block Elements</b>

<p> Inline elements simply end one line and begin another where as block elements create an invisible box around
 their content.  
</p>

<b>Span and Div Elements</b>

<p>The Span and DIv elements are used to contain their content and style elements which will adjust how that content
is displayed. Span is an inline element and Div is a block element. 
</p>

<b>Document Structure</b>

<p>The first element in an HTML document is the document type which assigns which type of HTML the document is. In 
HTML5 documents this string is simply HTML. The doctype tag is followed by the opening HTML tag which, along with
it's closing html tag, surround the entire document both head and body sction. Next is the head tag which can include Javascript and CSS style
elements. The head tag includes the title element which defines what is displayed in the browser tab. Next is the body
tag which cantains the contents of the document.
